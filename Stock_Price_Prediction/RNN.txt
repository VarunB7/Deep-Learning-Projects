Recurrent Neural Networks:
Deep learning is nothing but modelling the synthetic brain, now recurrent neural network can also be associated with a part of the brain based on its working.
The recurrent neural network is a part of supervised learning which utilizes short term memory in order to predict or to determine the future outcome. 

This type of mechanism can be found in the frontal lobe of the brain, based on this the RNN can be used in applications such as time series forecasting which 
predominantly uses the previous results which are temporarily stored in order predict the future outcomes
